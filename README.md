# Assignment 1

## Description

My motivation for this project is to show I can show HTML with semantic elements, comment on a CSS file, show my code has a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, provide accessible alt tags, have a descriptive title & it falls in a sequential order. This makes it easier to read and understand the code.

This project was build to demonstrate my abillity to solve problems within pre made code and follow the acceptance criteria. I learnt that when creating code, it needs to be as easy to read as possible to allow devs who haven't created it to read and understand the flow of the application.
